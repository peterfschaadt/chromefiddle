            <h3>About ChromeFiddle</h3>
            <p>ChromeFiddle was started as a personal project by <a href="http://peterschaadt.com" target="_blank">Peter Schaadt</a> to track the newest experimental features in Google's Chrome browser. I am highly interested in emerging web standards and hope that this site will encourage other users to enable and disable these experimental web components to create a browser environment of their choosing.</p>
